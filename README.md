Google Cloud Run Frontend

## Google Cloud Run
Using GCR as a serverless build manager has tons of benefits, from built in CI/CD, to automatic spin up / spin down, decent support, free tier, etc.

### Frontend
React? Flutter? Streamlit? So many bad options. 

### Backend
Flask. Hard to beat the basics here.
(TODO: consider best gcloud db for most situations: key-value, rds, etc.) 

### Setup
Install Python, Docker, GCP CLI 
Setup up CLI with credentials/billing account
Create service account with:
`gcloud run deploy` or `gcloud submit` for one off builds


#### Local:
`pip install requirements.txt`
(TODO: consider using docker-compose for local)
`docker build -p 8080:8080 -t local-ml`
View endpoint
To peek in container: `exec -it local-ml bash`
